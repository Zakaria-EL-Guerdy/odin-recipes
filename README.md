RECIPE WEBSITE:(only html)

This project is from The Odin Project website. It's the first project in the Foundations course, where I learned about various HTML elements and concepts, including images (img), anchors (a), paragraphs (p), headings, relative and absolute links.

In particular, I gained a deeper understanding of heading tags, paragraph tags, relative links and how they connect to other pages within the same website, image tags, and lists (ordered and unordered).

While the project was relatively simple, it provided a valuable foundation for developing my HTML skills and knowledge.
