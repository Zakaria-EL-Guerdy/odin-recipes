    <h2>Zaalouk Dip is a Famous Moroccan Dish</h2>
    <p> Morocco’s favourite way to make the most out of aubergines is without a doubt zaalouk! In the recipe, we are making a delicious dip based on my classic Zaalouk recipe. Easy and comforting, it’s definitely a crowd pleaser.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large aubergines (600g).</li>
      <li>4 medium tomatoes (320g), seeded and chopped.</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil.</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed .</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons paprika.</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon caster sugar.</li>
      <li>45ml olive oil.</li>
      <li>25g coriander.</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoon white wine vinegar.</li>
      <li>Salt to taste.</li>
      <li>Pinch caster sugar.</li>
      <li>70g crumbled feta.</li>
      <li>¼ medium red onion, sliced into half moons.</li>
      <li>Olive oil, to drizzle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove 3 vertical strips of skin from each aubergine. Discard the vertical strips and cut the aubergines in large cubes.</li>
      <li> Heat the olive oil in a large pan and add the aubergines, tomatoes, garlic, paprika, cumin, salt and sugar. Cover over medium-low heat until the vegetables are soft, about 25 to 35 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure the vegetables don’t stick to the pan.</li>
      <li>Uncover, mash the vegetables and leave over medium heat until all liquids evaporate. Keep the zaalouk in the fridge for up to 4 days and serve at room temperature.</li>
      <li>To make the coriander oil, combine coriander, olive oil, vinegar, salt and sugar in a food processor and process until very finely minced. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and sugar if necessary.</li>
      <li>To serve, spread the zaalouk in a shallow plate, garnish with the feta, coriander oil, sliced onions and a generous drizzle of olive oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
